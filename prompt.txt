Generate a detailed plan and initial code structure for a full-fledged 2D car racing game similar to Road Rash, implemented in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit. The game should include:

1.  **GUI:** A main game window using Swing, including menus (Start Game, Options, Exit), a game canvas/panel for rendering, and potentially overlay elements for score, speed, etc.
2.  **Game Loop:** A robust game loop for updating game state and rendering graphics.
3.  **Graphics:** 2D graphics rendering for cars, track, obstacles, and background elements. Consider using Java2D for drawing.
4.  **Car Physics:** Basic car movement, acceleration, braking, steering, and collision detection (with track boundaries, other cars, and obstacles).
5.  **AI:** Simple AI for opponent cars to race against the player.
6.  **Sound:** Integration of sound effects (engine, collisions, etc.) and background music.
7.  **Input Handling:** Keyboard input for player car control.
8.  **Game State Management:** Handling different game states (menu, playing, paused, game over).
9.  **Track Generation/Loading:** A method to define or load race tracks.
10. **Scoring/Progression:** Basic scoring system and potentially simple race progression (laps, finishing position).

Provide the following:

*   A high-level project structure and class diagram.
*   Initial code for the main game window and game loop setup.
*   Suggestions for libraries or approaches for graphics, sound, and physics.
*   A breakdown of the key components and steps required for development.

Focus on a clear, modular design that is easy to understand and extend.
